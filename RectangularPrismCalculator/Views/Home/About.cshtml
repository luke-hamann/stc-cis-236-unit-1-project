    This website allows you to run basic calculations for a rectangular prism given its dimensions.
</p>
<p>
    "Rectangular prism" is the formal geometric name for a box.
    The dimensions include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Length</li>
    <li>Width</li>
    <li>Height</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The program will then calculate:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Volume - how much space the prism occupies</li>
    <li>Surface area - the sum of the sizes of the faces of the prism</li>
    <li>Diagonal - the distance from one corner of the prism to the opposite corner</li>
</ul>
